        <h2>Introduction to Hacking</h2>
        <p>
            Hacking is the process of testing systems to see if they're secure or not. Imagine a locksmith testing a lock to see if it is secure. But not everyone uses hacking for good. Some people learn from locksmiths and use this skill to break in houses. Follow me as we learn this skill today.

        <h3>Types of hackers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>White hats</li>
                <li>Grey hats</li>
                <li>Black hats</li>
            </ul>

            <p>White hats are people who work for companies, get persmission to do things, and from the example earlier the locksmith who tests the lock. Grey hats are people that operate under illegal conditions but <i>mostly</i> report it. Grey hats act like they want to, like cracking in your house and leaving a note saying your lock is weak! Black hats are the ones you see in movies.</p>
