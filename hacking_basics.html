        <h2>Key concepts</h2>
        <p>
            Some things you <span class="highlight"><strong>need</strong></span> to know about hacking are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>IP(Internet Protocol)</li>
            <li>Ports</li>
            <li>Firewalls</li>
            <li>Packets</li>
        </ul>

        <p>IP's are identification codes of your devices. IP's usually aren't that important if you give it away, but once you do its like people knowing your social security number. Just like cities have roads to get people in and out, computers have ports to get data in and out. Think of a port like a branch off the main road. Firewalls are like security guards they let the safe cars(data) in and do not let the suspicious cars in. Open ports are like branches without security. You can let any car(data) in there and when you do some cars may have malicious data or as we like to call packets in them which in turn blow the building up.</p>
